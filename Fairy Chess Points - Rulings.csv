Long leapers cannot jump over jesters or fools
"Chamelons, if next to any freezing enemy (inquisitor, immobilzer, etc) will freeze the enemy unit, but will not freeze other things around them (including friendly units when next to an enemy herald)"
"The fool: moves and takes like a shogi pawn, but cannot be taken (like a jester): can only promote to jester"
Immobilizers (et al) can immobilize jesters/fools
Shogi pawns do not come with any drops
"En Passant can be done by Pawns, Peasants, and Shogi pawns, including against each other (except Shogi pawns, which can't move twice)"
Shogi pawns do not move twice first turn
"Freezing the enemy king (with a herald, inquisitor, or immobilizer) does not result in stalemate, so long as they have other moves"
"Castling: Move an unmoved king or regent 2 squares toward the unmoved rook or dragon, then move the rook ro dragon to the other side of the king (may not move if they started adjacent); cannot castle from, into, or through check)"
"Chameleons can move like knights to take knights and farie queens, and bounce off corners to take pontiffs, and generally take like what they take (including en passant)"
Chameleons do not freeze friendly heralds
"Chamberlains may take both on the squares they can jump to, and the squares they can capture (but may only move to capture squares to capture)"
"Regents transform on a loss of any queen-type piece, one of which you must take"
Jesters cannot be frozen
"fools cannot be jumped over; everything else can.  If jumping as a knight or knight like thing, both paths must be blocked to stop the jump"
"Chamberlains and kings can swap to get out of check and, if the chamberlain can move, out of immobilization"
"Phantom kings cannot swap with fools, but can with jesters"
Coordinators only take when they move; moving the king does not trigger taking squares that line up with coordinators
Phantom Kings can move pawn-type pieces to the back.  This does not count as a pawn moving
"If a pawn-type piece has not moved, and it can move two squares on it's first move, it can, so long as it is in the first or second rank (i.e. if a phantom king moves it to the third rank, it can no longer move twice)"
"Mercenary starts on A5 if picked as white, or h4 if picked as black"
